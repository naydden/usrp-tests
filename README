** Testing UHD with a USRP B210 **

UHD-based testing application.

To try it out, run these commands:
$ mkdir build/ # Creates a new build directory
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ make

This will find the UHD libraries, and link and compile the example
program. Include header directories and library names are automatically
gathered.

See the CMakeLists.txt file to figure out how to set up a build system.
